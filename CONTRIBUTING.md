# Contributing to JavaScript Security Patterns

Thank you for your interest in contributing to JavaScript Security Patterns! This project aims to provide battle-tested security implementations for JavaScript applications.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a professional and respectful environment focused on improving JavaScript security practices.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Security Issues

**IMPORTANT**: Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

For security-related issues, please email: nexusstudio100@gmail.com

### Suggesting New Patterns

1. **Check existing patterns** - Review current examples to avoid duplication
2. **Open an issue** - Describe the vulnerability and proposed solution
3. **Include references** - Link to OWASP guidelines or CVE databases
4. **Provide test cases** - Demonstrate both vulnerable and secure implementations

### Contributing Code

#### Requirements

All contributions must include:

- **Security test cases** demonstrating the pattern prevents specific vulnerabilities
- **Performance benchmarks** showing overhead measurements
- **Documentation** explaining the vulnerability and how the pattern mitigates it
- **Compatibility testing** across major JavaScript environments

#### Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/new-security-pattern`)
3. **Follow the pattern structure**:
   ```
   examples/XX-pattern-name/
   ├── README.md          # Pattern explanation
   ├── secure.js          # Secure implementation
   ├── insecure.js        # Vulnerable example (for education)
   └── test.js            # Security and performance tests
   ```
4. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run benchmark
   npm run security-audit
   ```
5. **Submit a pull request**

#### Code Standards

**Security Requirements:**
- No external dependencies for core security functions
- Input validation for all user-provided data
- Clear error handling without information disclosure
- Memory-safe operations where applicable

**Code Quality:**
- Modern JavaScript (ES2020+)
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comprehensive comments explaining security implications
- Performance-conscious implementations

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests covering normal and edge cases
- Security tests demonstrating attack prevention
- Performance benchmarks comparing secure vs insecure approaches
- Cross-environment compatibility tests

#### Pattern Documentation Template

Each pattern must include:

```markdown
# Pattern Name

## Vulnerability Description
- What vulnerability this pattern addresses
- OWASP/CWE reference numbers
- Real-world attack examples

## Secure Implementation
- Code example with explanations
- Security principles applied
- Performance characteristics

## Common Mistakes
- Insecure alternatives developers might use
- Why those approaches are vulnerable
- Migration path from insecure to secure

## Testing
- How to verify the pattern works correctly
- Security test cases included
- Performance impact measurements
```

### Documentation Improvements

- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add more comprehensive examples
- Improve code comments
- Update references to current security standards

### Performance Optimization

- Benchmark existing patterns
- Propose performance improvements
- Maintain security guarantees while optimizing
- Document performance impact of changes

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/js-security-patterns.git
cd js-security-patterns

# Install dependencies (minimal - we avoid external deps)
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run security audit
npm run security-audit
```

## Pattern Categories

We accept contributions in these areas:

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- User input validation
- Data type checking
- Length and format restrictions
- HTML/SQL injection prevention

### XSS Prevention
- DOM manipulation security
- Content Security Policy patterns
- Safe templating approaches
- URL validation and sanitization

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure session management
- Token handling patterns
- Permission checking implementations
- Rate limiting strategies

### Cryptography & Encoding
- Secure random number generation
- Hash function usage
- Encoding/decoding security
- Key management patterns

### Error Handling & Logging
- Secure error responses
- Information disclosure prevention
- Audit logging patterns
- Debugging security

## Review Process

1. **Automatic checks** - CI runs security audits and tests
2. **Security review** - Core team validates security properties
3. **Performance review** - Benchmark results evaluated
4. **Documentation review** - Clarity and completeness checked
5. **Integration testing** - Compatibility across environments
